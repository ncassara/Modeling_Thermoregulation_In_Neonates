# Modeling Thermoregulation In Neonates
MATH218: Math Modeling in Life Sciences - Final Independent Project

# Overview

This project was completed as the final semester-long independent project for MATH 218: Mathematical Modeling in the Life Sciences. It models how neonatal body temperature changes over time using principles of heat transfer and thermodynamics. The goal is to understand how factors like metabolism, environmental temperature, and heat loss mechanisms (radiation, convection, conduction, evaporation) affect thermoregulation in newborns.

# Methods

Developed a heat balance equation to describe gains and losses of heat.

Simplified model into a first-order differential equation for neonatal temperature.

Implemented an enhanced proportional–integral (PI) control model to simulate physiological regulation.

Simulated and visualized temperature changes using Euler’s method in Python.

# Results

The model successfully demonstrates how neonatal body temperature responds to different environmental conditions and interventions (e.g., incubator temperature). It provides a framework to explore optimal thermal support strategies for premature infants.
